- Lemmatization
- Stemming
- Text classification
- Entity extraction
- Semantic analysis
- Speech recognition
- Machine translation
- Multilingual sentiment analysis

## Requirements
- Swift 5.0 or higher
- Xcode 12 or higher
- Natural Language Framework

## Notes
- This repository is public and everyone is welcome to contribute with comments, suggestions and improvements.
- Each project addresses a different NLP technique or concept, starting with the most basic and moving to the most complex.
- The projects are organized in a logical order, allowing me to build my knowledge over time.
- This repository will be modified several times until I find all the concepts I have to study to learn NLP so expect drastic changes, especially in this first moment where I'm studying the basics of NLP.
